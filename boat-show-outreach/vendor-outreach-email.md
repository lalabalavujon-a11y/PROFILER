Hi [Vendor Name],

I hope you're having a successful Southampton Boat Show!

I noticed [Company Name] at the show and thought you'd be interested in our **AI-Powered Lead Intelligence System** that's specifically designed for marine industry vendors like yourself.

## What PROFILER Does for Boat Vendors:

✅ **Qualifies Show Visitors** - Automatically scores and segments leads from your booth
✅ **AI-Powered Analysis** - Identifies serious buyers vs. tire-kickers using GPT-4
✅ **Multi-Channel Follow-up** - Automated email, SMS, and social media campaigns
✅ **Sales Deck Generation** - Creates personalized presentations for each prospect
✅ **Real-Time Analytics** - Tracks conversion rates and ROI

## Special Boat Show Pricing (Ends Sept 28th):

🚢 **Setup Special**: £297 for 1,000 lead credits + full setup
🚢 **Monthly**: £99/month for ongoing lead generation
🚢 **Annual**: £990/year (save £198)
🚢 **Multi-Location**: £79/month per location (5+ locations)

## Why This Works for Marine Industry:

- **Long Sales Cycles**: Our AI helps identify buyers at different stages
- **High-Value Leads**: Focus on qualified prospects who can afford boats
- **Seasonal Business**: Year-round lead generation beyond boat shows
- **Competitive Edge**: Stand out from competitors still using spreadsheets

## Next Steps:
